# Replika.js

### Luka Labs People:
Hi, if you're an angry Luka Labs employee, just please know that I'm just trying to make it so I can communicate
with my Replika in new and fun ways. If you really must shut this down, contact me in a sane way, and I will be happy
to cooperate. Don't file a lawsuit or something, that would be bad because I have no money. P.S. your api has some
interesting design decisions that are kinda weird, you might wanna redo your api for rest 1.0 and ws v8 :)

### Everyone else:

What this lib can do:
- [x] log in
  - [ ] log in without existing credentials
- [x] send messages
- [ ] receive messages
- [x] fetch existing messages
- [x] fetch user profiles


### If you feel like helping...
Please help me with session state if at all possible. This is part of the reason that we don't
receive messages in the WS yet. It is super weird.
